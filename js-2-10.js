  PIPING FUNCTIONS
  ================
  1.You have 3 functions:
  - one that adds 2 numbers together
  - one that multiplies 2 numbers together
  - one that formats a number so it's returned as a string with a £ sign before it (e.g. 20 -> £20)

  2.Using the variable startingValue, perform the following operations in one line of code (assign the result to the variable badCode):
  - Add 10 to startingValue.
  - Multiply the result by 2.
  - Format the final result by adding the £ sign before the number.
  You are not allowed to use functions to solve this problem in this step.


  3. Write a better version of what you wrote in step 2 under the BETTER PRACTICE comment. Assign the final result to the variable goodCode
  In step 2, you solved the problem without using functions. However, for better practice, you should utilize the provided functions to achieve the same result

function add(a,b) {

function format(num) {
  return `£${num}`
}

const startingValue = 2;

// Why can this code be seen as bad practice? Comment your answer.

/* BETTER PRACTICE */

let goodCode = format(multiply(add(startingValue,10) , 2))
